## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Styled components have more flexibility and easy to reuse as they are components as well.
- Vite offers a faster development environment and lighter project files.

### Continued development

My next step is to learn Separation of Concerns in React:

- What does that mean?
- Container components
- Presentational Components
- their corresponding usage.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - This is always a life a saver.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Game changer in styling react components.
